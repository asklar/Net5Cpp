# Net5Cpp - interop between NET 5 and WinRT
This repo shows a WinRT component written in C# NET 5, exported through [cswinrt](http://github.com/microsoft/cswinrt) and consumed into a [C++/WinRT](http://github.com/microsoft/cppwinrt) [WinUI](http://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml) desktop app.


Currently building this repo relies on working around some cswinrt bugs, see https://github.com/microsoft/CsWinRT/issues/created_by/asklar
